PHP Virus Scanner

A very simple and fast scanner for common PHP exploits. I made this to combat the flood of attacks I was getting on several WordPress sites that I manage. Only 3 definitions at the moment but I will be adding more as I find them.

go get github.com/cjdell/php-virus-scanner

Usage Sample
------------

php-virus-scanner --scandir /var/www
